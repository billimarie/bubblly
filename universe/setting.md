### Bubblly

**Bubblly**, known to its inhabitants as *The Illustrious Sphere*, is the world where Bubblly takes place. Unlike our physical, material realm, Bubblly is an ethereal, abstract dimension full of knowledge, language, and sensations unknown to beings of earth.

One could say a visual representation would be inspired by Aristotle's Forms on Acid.
