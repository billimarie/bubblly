Bubbl is the MC's daemon, guide, and best friend. It's non-gendered. Deeply philosophical, playful, and codependent.

##### Sample Dialogue
> - "Oh! You got here faster than expected. So glad to have you! We’re just getting started...come in, come in!"

> - "The Illustrious Sphere welcomes you!"

> - "You're here! Now my day can *really* begin."

> - "Where are you? Well, I suppose you’re somewhere I'm not. That is, prancing out and about on earth, momentarily attempting to figure out how this strange web app works..."

> - "I’m BUBBL! Your companion here in BUBBL.LY. My world was created to help **you** manage **your money**. Not only do I guide you through all of BUBBL.LY...I am also irrevocably bonded to you..."

> - "But first, the basics! Create a bubbl like me. Bubbls are a way to organize your Monetary Goals. Some example bubbls include: *Pay Rent (on time). Save Part of Paychecks. Learn about IRAS.* It can be anything you want! In fact, I once met a guy named *Buy The Entire Freakin' World!* Hehehe.

> - "My entire existence is dedicated to keeping you on track. I show off your stats. I create graphs and charts of your progress. I even archive your notes for future motivation! That means when you’re being financially productive, I’m happy! But when you’re not...I pop. Bubbls that remain inactive will expire, taking your hopes & dreams for financial stability with it. Bubbls that survive, persist, and thrive will continuously Level Up, receive Specialty Items, and gain recognition in the elusive Glory Bubbl!"

> - "Come! The world is ours: puff, puff&mdash;to the Illustrious Sphere!"
