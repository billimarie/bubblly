# TODO (but really, notes for now)

### Logic

- player enters in financial information manually? vs. connecting to banks (security)
  * based on their current financial situation, mirror appropriate Gear, Points, Levels, Allies, Bosses, etc.? o_o
    - JSON data?
- player can gain skills by:
  * actually playing the game and winning
  * library room (idk) where you can answer questions, create goals, etc. and the act of thinking about that stuff will help you gain points

### Research

- CDN
- HTML5 Canvas
- HTML5 Game Development Frameworks
- JavaScript (!o_o)
