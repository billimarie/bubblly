# Bubbl.ly

**Bubbl.ly** is a tactical RPG which makes **managing your Personal Finances fun**. This is a personal project to help me accomplish three long-term goals: get stronger at web development, experiment with game development, & better understand capital, stocks, IRAs, budgeting :smile_cat:

## Updates

### Research

- decided upon only using HTML & JavaScript
  * HTML5 Canvas (PlayCanvas?), WebSockets, node.js

### Story

- currently developing storyline (see [storyline.md](https://github.com/billimarie/bubblly/blob/master/universe/storyline.md))
